# Robust-and-Adaptive-Functional-Logistic-Regression
Repository containing functions and programs used in Kalogridis I. (2023) "Robust and Adaptive Functional Logistic Regression".
The adaptive density power divergence estimator discussed in the paper is implemented with the dpd.f function contained within the
"Main Functions" file. That file also contains an implementation of density power divergence estimators with fixed tuning with the dpd.ffa
function. The files "Simulations" and "Gait Analysis" provide code reproducing the figures and numerical results in sections 5 and 6 of the
paper.
